# Goatshriek at a Glance
I'm a C and Ruby fan who's always looking to learn more about how things work.
For that reason my projects tend to vary as I find new and interesting things
to dig into, but I do have a few projects that I consistently work on.

## Main Projects
 * [Stumpless](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless) is a passion project to
   take something very simple (logging) and do it very well. I've used it as a
   way to learn and incorporate all sorts of development technologies from build
   platforms to Continuous Integration solutions, and continue to learn new
   things from it every day, from the finer parts of C programming to how to
   build and package a portable library that will run anywhere! Because this
   project started primarly as a learning tool for myself, I make sure that
   there are always `good first issue`s for anyone looking to learn more about
   OSS contribution to try out. If you want to get involved in Open Source and
   want to kick the tires on a contribution that's more than adding your name
   to a text file,
   [this](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless/labels/good%20first%20issue)
   is a great place to start!
 * [Ruby Dragon](https://github.com/goatshriek/ruby-dragon) is a plugin for
   NSA's [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) SRE tool
   that allows you to use more languages than the Java and Jython options that
   come standard. It's a reflection of my love of learning new programming
   languages and belief that you should be able to use any tool from any
   language. If you have a JVM-based language you think should be included, be
   sure to open an issue for it to get added!
 * [Wrapture](https://github.com/goatshriek/wrapture) is a project that started
   out as a simple script in stumpless to create C++ wrappers for the library.
   It's under active work to become a full-fledged code generation tool for
   wrapping C libraries in other languages, but has a ways to go yet. For the
   time being, you're better off checking out something like
   [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/),
   [GObject](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [Haxe](https://haxe.org/)
   if you need to do this. But if you're really curious, star the repo and
   keep an eye on it - I do plan to make it a viable option in due time!
